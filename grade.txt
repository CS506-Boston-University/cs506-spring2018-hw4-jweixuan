Task 1

a) Transform categorical column to numerical: 2/2

 
Task 2

a) Report the summary of the model: 1/1

b) Mean squared error computation: 1/1

c) Explanation of OLS regression results and statistically significant predictors: 1/1


Task 3

a) Perform regularization using ridge fit: 1/1

b) Perform Kfold cross-validation and report best model + shuffle data: 0.5/1 (regularization and linear model evaluation not performed on same datasets - differnt loop for each)

c) Evaluate all 4 ridge regression parameters alpha: 1/1

d) Comments on which model you prefer and why: 0.5/0.5

e) Comments on the effect of alpha: 0.5/0.5



Task 4

a) Add quadratic terms of significant variables in regularized model: 1/1

b) Perform kfold cross-validation on linear model and regularized quadratic model + Report MSE + shuffle data: 1/1

c) Comments of results if too many quadratic or cubic terms added: 1/1



Total: 11.5/12
